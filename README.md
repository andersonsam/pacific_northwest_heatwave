# Pacific Northwest Heatwave of June 2021: Cryosphere and Streamflow
The code to reproduce the 'Cryosphere and Streamflow' section of the paper:  
White, R. et al., "The Unprecedented Pacific Northwest Heatwave of June 2021" (submitted 2022).  
___  
We use observed streamflow from 9 stream gauge stations to characterize differences in their responses to the June 2021 heat wave.  The stations used are:  
* BRIDGE RIVER (SOUTH BRANCH) BELOW BRIDGE GLACIER (08ME023)
* HOMATHKO RIVER AT THE MOUTH (08GD004)
* NORTH SASKATCHEWAN RIVER AT WHIRLPOOL POINT (05DA009)
* CHILLIWACK RIVER ABOVE SLESSE CREEK (08MH103)
* FRASER RIVER AT SHELLEY (08KB001)
* SKEENA RIVER AT USK (08EF001)
* ELK RIVER AT FERNIE (08NK002)
* SALMO RIVER NEAR SALMO (08NE074)
* OYSTER RIVER BELOW WOODHUS CREEK (08HD011)  

We compare 2021 streamflow to historical observed flows and characterize how both the initial response (during the heat wave) and delayed response (in the months after the heat wave) vary across different levels of glacier coverage and snowpack state.
